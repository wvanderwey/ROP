## What is ROP?

ROP is a computational protocol aimed to discover the source of all reads, which originate from complex RNA molecules, recombinant antibodies and microbial communities. The ROP accounts for 98.8% of all reads across poly(A) and ribo-depletion protocols, compared to 83.8% by conventional reference-based protocols. ROP profiles repeats, circRNAs, gene fusions, trans-splicing events, recombined B/T-cell receptor sequences and microbial communities.  The ‘dumpster diving’ profile of unmapped reads output by our method is not limited to RNA-Seq technology and might be applied to whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing.
