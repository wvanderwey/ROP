## ROP analysis of one RNA-Seq sample

In this step we will show how to analyze one RNA-Seq sample. We use RNA-Seq sample of normal skin (SRR1146076) as a training sample downloaded from [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54456). Please note 
that proposed sample is not necessarily the typical sample and is provided for demonstration purposes.
