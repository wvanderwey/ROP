Here we describe the output structure of the ROP pipeline. The details of the ROP pipeline are explain [here] (https://github.com/smangul1/rop/wiki/What-is-ROP). The ROP output consist of six directories corresponding to six steps of the ROP analysis of the unmapped reads. 


Additionally it contains two directories corresponding to optional modules to characterize the mapped reads.
